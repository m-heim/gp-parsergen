# gppgen
An easy to use parser generator, a side project to help build a parser for my compiler Npc, feel free to use for your project, make sure to follow the license agreement.

The program is mostly aimed at generating a parser from a grammar, since it will have many functions that can be useful in other cases, e.g. rewriting a grammar, the gp-parsergen program can also be used to transform grammars.
